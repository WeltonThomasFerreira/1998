- **Cards:** A standard 52-card deck (no jokers).
- **Objective:** Be the first to discard all your cards.

### Setup

1. **Deal:** Each player receives **7 cards**.
2. **Draw Pile:** Remaining cards face down in the center.
3. **Foundation Piles:** Turn over the **top 4 cards** of the pile and place them face up in a cross formation. These start the discard piles.
- **Kings in the Foundation:** If a King is one of these 4 starting cards, it remains there.
4. **King Spaces:** The four diagonal (corner) spaces are reserved for Kings drawn from your hand.

### How to Play (Your Turn)

1. **Draw a card** from the draw pile. 2. Discard as many cards as you can/want from your hand, following these rules:
- From the Foundation Piles: Play cards in descending sequence (K > A) and of opposite color (red on black, black on red).
- Ex: On a 10♥, play a 9♠ or 9♣.
- Aces are the lowest cards; nothing can be played on them.
- Corner Kings: If you have a King in your hand, you can place it on any of the four empty corner spaces. It starts a new pile that follows the same rules of opposite color and decreasing value.
- Moving Piles: A complete pile can be moved onto another pile if the bottom card of the moved pile is of opposite color and immediately lower value than the top card of the destination pile. This frees up the space from which the pile originated. - **Filling Empty Spaces:** If one of the 4 foundation pile spaces (N, S, L, O) becomes empty, you may start a new pile there with **any card** from your hand.
3. Your turn ends when you can/will not play any more cards.
