- **Cards:** Standard 52-card deck(s) (no Jokers).

- 2-3 players: 1 deck.
- 4-5 players: 2 decks.

- **Objective:** Be the first to get rid of all your cards.

- **Card Hierarchy (from lowest to highest):** 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, **10**, J, Q, K, A, **2**.

- **Special Cards:**
- **2s:** Can be played on any card. They "reset" the discard pile, and the next player can play **any card** to start a new sequence.
- **10s:** When a 10 is played, it **burns** the discard pile**. All cards in the pile are removed from play (they don't come back!). The player who played the 10 gets another turn and starts a new pile.

### Setting Up Your "Palace"

1. Each player receives **3 cards face down** in front of them (you can't look at them).
2. On top of each card, place **3 cards face up** (you can look at these!).
3. Receive **3 cards for your hand**.
4. **Exchange Cards (Optional):** Before starting play, you can exchange any card in your hand for the 3 cards face up on the table. The idea is to put good cards (high or special) on the table.
5. The rest of the deck forms the **Draw Pile** face down. Turn over the top card to start the **Discard Pile** (if it's a 2 or 10, turn over the next card).

### How to Play (Your Turn)

The first player starts (usually to the left of the dealer), and play proceeds clockwise.

1. **Playing Cards from Hand:**
- You must play one or more cards from your hand onto the discard pile.
- The card(s) played must have a value equal to or greater than the top card on the discard pile.
- You can play multiple cards together if they have the same value (e.g., two 7s, three Queens).
- **Four of a Kind:** If you play four cards of the same value at once (e.g., four 8s), the pile also **"burns"** (like a 10). You play another card and start a new pile.
2. **Drawing Cards:**
- After playing, you **must draw** cards from the draw pile until you have 3 cards in your hand. (If you already have 3 or more, you don't draw.)
3. **Can't Play? (Draw from the Draw Pile)**
- If you have no valid cards in your hand to play, you are **forced to draw the entire Discard Pile** and add it to your hand. Your turn ends.

### Game Phases (When the Hand Ends)

The game progresses in 3 phases, in this order:

1. **Hand Phase:** You play only the cards in your hand and draw from the Draw Pile.
2. **Face-Up Phase:** When you have no more cards in your hand (and the Draw Pile is empty), you begin playing your 3 cards **face-up** on the table.
- Play one at a time, following the same value rules (equal or higher) or using special cards.
- If you cannot play the face-up card, you draw the entire Discard Pile** to your hand. You must play these cards from your hand first, before trying the ones on the table again.
3. **Face-Down Phase:** When you have no more cards in your hand or face-up cards, you begin playing your 3 cards **face-down**.
- Turn over one card at a time (without looking first!) and try to play it.
- If it's valid, you play it. If it's not valid, you are **forced to take the entire Discard Pile** (including the one you just turned over) to your hand. You play these cards from your hand before trying the face-down ones again.
