### The Game (Your Turn)

Each player must do the following:

1. **Discard:** Discard at least one card from your hand to the face-up discard pile.
- **Allowed Discard Types:**
- A **single card**.
- Two or more cards with the **same value** (e.g., two 7s, three Qs), but of different suits (e.g., 7‚ô•Ô∏è, 7‚ô†Ô∏è or Q‚ô£Ô∏è, Q‚ô¶Ô∏è, Q‚ô†Ô∏è).
- Three or more cards in **sequence of the same suit** (e.g., 3‚ô£Ô∏è, 4‚ô£Ô∏è, 5‚ô£Ô∏è).
- **Standard Straight:** A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K.
- **Joker (üÉè):** Only one Joker (üÉè) can be used to replace any other card in a straight, but it can **never** be the first or last card in the straight.
2. **Draw:** After discarding, draw only one card. - You may draw the top card of the **discard pile** (the last one discarded) **OR** the top card of the face-down **stock**.
- **Special Straight Draw:** If you discard a straight, the next player may choose to draw the first or last card of your discarded straight instead of drawing from the stock.
3. **Immediate Discard (Optional):** If you discarded only one card and the card you drew is equal (same value) to the one you discarded, you may discard it immediately. This ends your turn.
4. **Pass:** Your turn ends and the next player plays.

They add the value of their hand **plus 30 penalty points** to their overall score. Players who actually have the lowest total points win the round and add the total value of their hands to the overall score.
